      <description>A lesson in chaotic data. I&amp;rsquo;ve posted this on , but I figured it would be appropriate to share on this page. This graduate school project was a high-level exercise in data wrangling, joining, manipulating, exploring, and analyzing.&#xA;To give you an idea of now nothing came easy on this project, I chose to use a Levenshtein distance function across thousands of rows as a soft join. This was one of a few choices I made over the course of the project, given time restrictions and minimum requirements.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my page. I plan on populating this with professional achievements and some personal musings &amp;ndash; using it as a half-portfolio, half-thought page.&#xA;(I like the terminal themed page. My wife thinks it&amp;rsquo;s kind of dumb. It might be both.)&#xA;Myself in a summary: I am a perpetually curious individual with a knack for solving problems. I am a disciple of the scriptures and am seeking God&amp;rsquo;s kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.</description>
